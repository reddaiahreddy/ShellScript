Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
Login to AWS Management Console:

Go to the AWS Management Console.
Log in with your AWS credentials.
Create an S3 Bucket:

Navigate to the S3 service.
Click "Create bucket".
Enter a unique bucket name (e.g., my-event-trigger-bucket).
Choose the AWS region where you want to create the bucket.
Leave other settings as default and click "Create bucket".
Step 2: Create an IAM Role for Lambda
Navigate to IAM Service:

Go to the IAM service in the AWS Management Console.
Create a New Role:

Click "Roles" in the sidebar, then "Create role".
Select "AWS service" and choose "Lambda" as the use case.
Click "Next: Permissions".
Attach Policies:

Search for and select the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess policy.
Add another policy for CloudWatch logs (AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole).
Review and Create Role:

Click "Next: Tags", then "Next: Review".
Give your role a name (e.g., lambda-s3-role).
Click "Create role".
Step 3: Create a Lambda Function
Navigate to Lambda Service:

Go to the Lambda service in the AWS Management Console.
Create a New Function:

Click "Create function".
Choose "Author from scratch".
Give your function a name (e.g., S3EventProcessor).
Choose Python 3.8 (or another runtime of your choice).
Under "Permissions", choose "Use an existing role" and select the role you created earlier (lambda-s3-role).
Click "Create function".
Add Code to Lambda Function:

Replace the default code with the following Python code:
python
Copy code
import json
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    for record in event['Records']:
        bucket = record['s3']['bucket']['name']
        key = record['s3']['object']['key']
        print(f'File {key} uploaded to bucket {bucket}')
        # Add your processing logic here

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('File processed successfully')
    }
Deploy the Function:

Click "Deploy" to save your changes.
Step 4: Configure S3 to Trigger Lambda
Navigate to S3 Bucket:

Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
Select the bucket you created earlier (my-event-trigger-bucket).
Set Up Event Notification:

Go to the "Properties" tab of the bucket.
Scroll down to the "Event notifications" section and click "Create event notification".
Enter a name for the event (e.g., UploadTrigger).
In the "Event types" section, check "All object create events".
In the "Destination" section, choose "Lambda function" and select the Lambda function you created earlier (S3EventProcessor).
Click "Save changes".
Step 5: Test the Setup
Upload a File to S3:

Go to the "Objects" tab of your S3 bucket.
Click "Upload" and add a file to the bucket.
Check Lambda Execution:

Navigate to the CloudWatch service in the AWS Management Console.
Go to "Log groups" and find the log group for your Lambda function (/aws/lambda/S3EventProcessor).
Check the log stream to see the logs from the Lambda function execution. You should see log entries indicating the file upload event.
